# medley-de-bugger

Hello! MedleyDeBugger is an app to process your multitracks for error before you upload them to our awesome database (see more at https://github.com/marl/medleydb). 

To use this app:

1. Clone the repository to your local drive.
2. Navigate to the 'new_multitrack' folder (via command-line).
3. On the command line, type: 'python new_multitrack.py' - this should run the application!
4. Follow the prompts to select your audio and run it through the app.
5. After you're done, a nice new folder should be generated with your corrected audio and the correct naming format. Complete!
